<p>
When we see an underwater photography, we often ask where is that place. Generally, those places are located at distant locations with difficult access and almost virgin. Just like this it’s Capurganá, with one of the last virgin reefs of the world, every dive site stands out for its diversity and stunning coral reefs, which provide a home to a large number of species.
</p><p>
Capurganá is influenced by the closer rivers mouth and its underwater visibility is better in some periods of the year (from April to November). Here, you will find wall dives from 15 to 120 feet deep, special for certificated divers. For beginners there are also special sites with less deeps and controlled conditions.
</p><p>
In our dives you will see a huge coral and animal variety: molluscs, lobsters, spider crabs, atlantic mantas, spotted eagle ray, nurse sharks, hawksbill turtles, jewfish, bluetang, angelfishes, damselfishes, parrotfishes, spotted drum, trumpetfishes, squirrelfishes, hind, snapper, grunt, butterflyfishes, rockbeauty, cowfishes, trunkfishes, balloonfishes, peje puerco; anyway the huge variety that the Caribbean offers.
</p><p>

<@section "How to get to Capurgana" "comoLlegar">
Capurganá can be reached by different ways, and from different national or international cities.
</p><p>
The most common way is to travel by plane from the principal cities of Colombia (Cali, Bogotá, Cartagena, Bucaramanga, Pasto, …) to the Medellín’s airport “Olaya Herrera”. There you will take the airline ADA, and you will be connected to Capurganá in a plane for 17 passengers. In about 1 hour and ten minutes you will be with us. The flights to Capuraganá are from Monday to Saturday at 10:00 am.
</p><p>
If you are in an international city, you can travel to the Albrook airport in Panama City and from there take a plane to the Obaldia dock, which is the Colombia’s frontier town. Then take a launch and in 20 minutes you will be in Capurganá. While traveling by launch you could enjoy the view and the nature, and see how the most beautiful mountains end in the white beaches of the Caribbean Sea.
</p><p>
Another option, if you are plenty of time and want to know more places, is to make the trip by car and launch. You can travel by bus to Medellin. There is better to rest during the rest of the day and take a bus to Turbo at night. This trip takes 7 hours. The idea is to be early in the morning to the Turbo’s dock and to buy a ticket to travel by launch to Capurganá. The departure time is 8:00 a.m. and it is just once a day. The trip takes 2 hours and a half, and you could see the Caribbean coast of Darien, its exuberant view, and its beaches and seaside towns.

The Cuevas and Cunas Indians were the colonist of this land. The Cunas baptized it as Capurganá which means chilli’s land, and then they moved on to Panama and other towns in Chocó. Later, some families from Cartagena and around came. Those families, now traditional, like the Pertuz, Pautt, Pacheco, Buendía, and Navas, lived thanks to the coconut and Tagua nut trading.
The Capurgana’s economy, like other seaside towns, has depended on fishing and agriculture, but thank to its beautiful places has become in a tourist destine. José María Palacio was the first one who built cabins to receive tourists. Then, others followed him and nowadays Capurganá has 5 hotels:
